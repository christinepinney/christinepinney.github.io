OVERVIEW:

Priority Queue implements MaxHeap using an array to simulate CPU round-robin scheduling for process objects. Processes are compared first by priority level, then arrival time if priority levels are equal.


INCLUDED FILES:

 * Averager.java - provided to support CPUScheduling
 * CPUScheduling.java - provided driver class for simulation
 * MaxHeap.java - defines a max heap array
 * PQueue.java - priority queue implementation of MaxHeap
 * Process.java - defines process objects
 * ProcessGenerator.java - generates new processes for queue
 * README - this file


COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 $ javac *.java

 Run the simulation with the command:
 $ java CPUScheduling <maxProcessTime> <maxPriorityLevel> <timeToIncrementPriority> <simulationTime> <processArrivalRate>

Console output will output simulation results generated by CPUScheduling. 


TESTING:

To test simulation for correctness, I compared my simulation output with the provided output by running the following command:
$ ./run_test <probability>

The program runs a diffcheck, so no output means the outputs match exactly and the simulation was completed correctly.
